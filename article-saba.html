                        <h2>Abstract</h2>
                        <p>Rise against intolerance towards symbols and attires of religious importance has led to mass protests across the global. The huge criticism is propounded on the doctrine of ‘secularism’ and demands the termination of such practices in its entirety. At the same time, some countries have also played a significant role in limiting the right to freedom of religious and culture expression by imposing laws concerning only the state authorities. Both secular as well as theocratic states have thus played a role in the amplification of religious as well as cultural intolerance amongst the masses.</p>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Often, we stumble upon a news article stating the restriction of specific symbol or clothing due to profound religious discrimination that exists worldwide. Or in other cases (such as the Middle East countries), we discover religious dress codes being enforced on women against their will, for such theocratic states use ‘religion’ as a means to campaign for the ‘immortal’ patriarchy. Women are often told what to wear and what not to, either by their own family members or the people around them. The most disheartening thing to see in today’s time is that the very fundamental laws that were made to protect human rights now mandate people to wear clothes or symbols according to one’s country belief or ideologies. Why is there a constant need to make people wear things against their own form of self-expression? Even the most secular states (in ‘written constitution’) resort to restricting people’s Right to clothing. The recent ban of headscarves worn by Muslim women as a form of their religious expression in France speaks volumes of the increasing demolition of the Right to freedom of expression. Hence, this paper attempts to discuss the impact of such laws restricting people’s Right to expression of religion and culture in society through country-specific case studies and tries to find a pragmatic solution to the problem.</p>
                        <p>Many laws drafted by states also reflect upon the suppression of one gender, restricting them in their prescribed gender norms. As in most cases, it is woman’s clothing that is questioned by society at large. Theocratic states consisting of one state religion, such as Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, incorporate different, harsh punishments for the women (who are the so-called divine symbols of a country’s religious stature) in case they fail to abide by the religion-based laws (Doumato). Such practices contribute towards grave human rights violations in the hands of several country- specific legislations around the globe. And hence in order to safeguard the rights and will of citizens at large, such laws call for speculation in view of the international treaties and conventions.</p>
                        <p>While there has been research conducted on the violation of the Right to religious freedom of expression with the proposition of laws, we attempt to analyse the laws of different political systems and their sociological impact on its citizens. Focussing on the different models of approach, the discourse of the paper will try to deduce the best model that should be followed.</p>
                        <h2>I. Countries whose legal system is enshrined with the doctrine of 'secularism'</h2>
                        <h3>A. Secular State: France</h3>
                        <p>Over the years, various countries have enshrined different legal systems in accordance with varied socio-religious dynamics. Similarly, in France, there exists a separation between state authority and religion. The French Constitution encourages the principle of laïcité, wherein the French state and government avoid taking a stance on matters of religious significance and maintains neutrality towards the religious beliefs of the masses (Mohanty 46). Adding to this pretext, people are required to keep their personal and public life separate as two different dimensions wherein one’s religious form of expression should not come in light of the public sphere. Although such principles were formulated in order to keep uniformity and equality amongst its citizen, it fails to account for the various international documents that cherish the foundational principles of secularism and modernity (which mostly all European countries are signatories of) (Črnič 113). Such conventions and declarations&nbsp;promote the persistence of humanity and tolerance amongst the global citizens. And thus, the signatories ought to respect such provisions and incorporate the same within their national boundaries. While in reality, many countries construct their own interpretations to suit their country’s own narrative and belief.</p>
                        <p>In practical terms, it is evident to notice that most religions are not concerned with one practising one’s religious beliefs according to any preferred surroundings. Religious codes strive to regulate a person’s entire life and hence do not differentiate between public and private lives (Mohanty 46). If any religion requires one to wear a religious attire or symbol, it is to be carried in both public and private spheres. Thus, it is inherently impossible for a person to profess their faith with complete freedom in a country like France (where one is forbidden to express their faith in public). It implies that a “secular” country such as France does not uphold the basic fundamental rights as they find their roots deeply embedded in the laïcité principle. Moreover, France guarantees equality of all irrespective of one’s religion, and at the same time, refuses to include religion as a matter of the state. Such a provision is extremely problematic when it comes to safeguarding or protecting one’s individual rights, and at the same time demolishes the essence of the same ‘secularism’ that the state vowed to stand for.</p>
                        <p>In 2004, the French government passed a law banning “conspicuous religious symbols’ such as the Muslim headscarf, Sikh turban and the Jewish skullcap. Furthermore, in 2010, a law was passed forbidding Muslim women to conceal their faces in public, robbing them of their Right to freedom of religious expression. Similarly, in 2021, the French Senate’s move&nbsp;to ban the hijab for girls under the age of 18 in the public sphere led to widespread criticism and massive protests worldwide (#HandsoffMyHijab). While it has not been passed yet, it showcases that such laws formulated in the name of “French secularism” deprive people of the root essence of the principle of ‘secularism’ where all individuals are guaranteed the freedom of religion to practice and profess in whichever way that suits them. Amnesty International stated that this proposed ban of headscarves poses a “serious attack on rights and freedom in France” and demanded the scrapping of “many problematic provisions” (Aljazeera). Moreover, such propositions in the court of law prevent the states from formulating social reforms for religious minorities residing in the country. While it is noteworthy that religious minorities are subjected to atrocities committed in the name of ‘intolerance’, the state by virtue of its neutral stand in matters of religious significance would then do nothing to cherish and protect its people (minorities).</p>
                        <h3>B. Secular State: South Africa</h3>
                        <p>Like many other countries such as New Zealand, Canada, South Africa is known to respect religious and cultural diversity, and the Constitution itself safeguards the people’s Right to the Expression of Religion in both public and private spheres. The makers of the constitution for the state of South Africa have inherently made sure to respect the diversified needs and whims of the citizens. Owing to its vehemently prolonged period of attaining Independence (getting rid of the elitist white superiority), this particular nation has efficiently provided legislations so as to protect the sentiments of the plethora of races and religious beliefs which continue to strive on its motherland. People are free to profess their religions respectfully without the constant fear of being subjected to grave punishments by the state authorities itself.</p>
                        <p><strong><em>Constitutional Provisions related to Right of Religion:</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Article 9 of the South African Constitution ensures equality to the citizens with no discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs. Article 31 of the same Constitution gives the Right of practising one’s culture to any religious or religious community. Moreover, Article 15, enshrined in the Bill of Rights, ensures religious observances in public institutions and facilities, provided that the rules are followed in accordance with the authorities.</p>
                        <p>The Constitution of South Africa accommodates the interests of all religions and thus holds true to the essence of ‘secularism’. Unlike the French approach to secularism and freedom of religious expression wherein the state maintains ‘neutrality’ by not getting engaged in the matters of religion, the South African approach recognises the fundamental rights of an individual by incorporating rights associated with religious freedom within the ambit of state affairs. The concept of religious observation enclosed within the national boundaries might seem not so ‘uniform’ to a country that follows the French approach. Nevertheless, in reality, the South African model owing to its high significance and pragmatic approach, is practised vividly in countries such as India and Canada. These countries allow people to express religious symbols in both public as well as private spheres, without any restrictions imposed by inhumane laws.</p>
                        <h3>C. Secular State: India<br>(Partial Separation between State and Religion)</h3>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><strong><em>Constitutional Provisions relating to Right of Religion (source the Constitution of India):</em></strong><br></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 25</span>: Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion.</li>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 26</span>: Freedom to manage religious affairs.</li>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 27</span>: Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion.</li>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article 28</span>: Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After the formation of two different countries post-independence in 1947, India came to be known as a secular state safeguarding religious and cultural rights to each individual regardless of their personal belief. The state thus intervenes in matters related to religious affair and helps in the formulation of various religion-based laws for various socio-political reasons. Justice K. Ramaswamy by stating that “secularism is, therefore, part of the fundamental law and basic structure of the Indian political system to secure to all its people socio-economic needs essential for man’s excellence with material and moral prosperity and political justice,” very well articulates the root foundations of this very secular diverse state (Singh 599). The laws and legislations allow the people to wear religious attires and symbols in both the private and public sphere, not restricting it to certain preferred surroundings or closed spaces. People across the Indian territory wear burqas, niqabs, turbans, sarees, and many other religious symbols. And if one gets discriminated against or harassed for practicing their expression of religion, they can knock on the doors of the court for an infringement of their personal right. India, owing to its multicultural society, thus, tries to accommodate the rights of all its citizen. And inherently provides with adequate legislation for the ones who have somehow faced the brunt of religious discrimination or intolerance. The Indian approach to the principle of ‘secularism’ differs from the French approach of ‘secularism’ (based on laïcité principle) as the Indian model advocates for the doctrines of inclusivity (based on religious communities) and humanity. While France prides itself aligning with the principles of ‘secularism’, it is India (and many other countries who recognize the Right to Freedom of Religion and Expression) which truly stands as a secular state in its entirety. Furthermore, the South African approach to secularism was drafted on the same lines as the Indian one, as they both stand for the Right to freedom of religious expression (clothing in this case). With the rise of modernity and liberalism, people possess the will to carry out anything with their desire, and not even the national laws can curtail one’s human rights in its claws.</p>
                        <p>However, there have been several challenges to the idea of secularism within the country. One of the main challenges to secularism in India is religious and communal politics, which stems from conflict in interest. Since the 1980s, we have seen the rise in formation of the various religion-based organizations, such as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Shiv Sena and All Indian Muslim League, who use their power to gain political mileage and thus influence the masses in creating a divide between the different religious communities (Singh 603). While it looks like such organizations may be secular in theory but on the contrary, many of them possess a radical approach in handling handle affairs related to religious interests. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) reports of 2016 and 2018, the practice of anti-conversion laws (Mathur) (in different states) are significantly used to “create a hostile, and on occasion violent, environment for religious minority communities” as they are misused to create communal differences among the people (Love-Jihad law recently passed in Uttar Pradesh is one such law used inappropriately in many cases). Although the Constitution of India was formulated keeping in the ideas of secularism, freedom to religion and democracy in the 1940s, it has now started to sweep away from its roots lately.</p>
                        <p>With the growing communal indifferences in the recent years, Rakesh Bajrangi, a Bajrang Dal leader, proposed the ban of pheran in the Kashmir valley while claiming that clothing helps the militant carry firearms. In 2014, Kashmiri journalists were forbidden from wearing this cultural attire at different events held by these occupational forces. However, it was soon scrapped off due to the enormous criticism it brought upon itself. Moreover, Satya Pal Malik, the Governor of J&amp;K in 2018, banned people from wearing pheran at a few of its offices (Malik). The practice to ban a piece of clothing is submissively present in the Indian territories as well. While the government fails to recognize the importance of a cultural attire in the lives of ordinary people, it also infringes the Right to freedom of cultural and religious expression, guaranteed to its citizen with the help of the Constitution. It is therefore necessary for the people ‘sitting in power’ to not use its impressionable citizens for their own political gain. And it is equally important for the citizens of India to reinvent the foundational principles of its native territory and respect the rich cultural diversity of various communities residing in the same ecosystem.</p>
                        <h2>I. Countries whose legal system is not enshrined with the doctrine of 'secularism'</h2>
                        <h3>A. Theocratic State: Saudi Arabia<br>(No separation between the state and religion)</h3>
                        <p>The Basic Law of Governance (1992) of Saudi Arabia states Islam as the official religion of the state, and the Constitution is thus drafted according to the principles and teachings of the Quran. The legal system is formulated on the basis of the sharia law (Interpreted as per the Hanbali School of Sunni Islamic Jurisprudence) and therefore does not recognize any religion other than Islam (Doumato 568). Freedom of religion is prohibited, and the citizens are not allowed to practice or profess their religions in public spheres. Although it allows people to practice their faith within the boundaries of their domestic spheres, it fails to comply with the fact that religious practices (other than that of Islam) are not limited to restricted spaces. Moreover, the law criminalises “the promotion of atheistic ideologies in any form” and “any attempt to cast doubt on the fundamentals of Islam,” or publications that “contradict the provisions of Islamic law” (International Religious Freedom Report 2020). And thus, condemns the display of non-Islamic symbols and other acts involving religious worship.</p>
                        <p> In theocratic countries like Saudi Arabia, the state is closely linked to matters of religious affairs (unlike the French approach mentioned in the above section) and are responsible for drafting laws as per their conservative beliefs. While one country is forcing women to wear niqabs and abayas to preserve Islamic ideologies (Saudi Arabia), the other is proposing laws to ban such religious attires from public places (France). What these both countries inculcate in commonality are the forced measures undertaken to deny the Right to freedom of expression of religion and culture. It is crucial to notice that though France constitutes itself as a “secular” state imbibing the principles of equality, it is, in this case, stepping on the path laid down by a theocratic state like Saudi Arabia. Both countries disregard the true essence of democracy and secularism, for they are very much radical in understanding jurisprudence.</p>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>With the discourse of the paper, we have tried to discuss the persistence of laws infringing or guaranteeing the Right to Freedom of Religious as well as cultural expression. We realise that due to the increasing awareness of human rights and the formation of secular-democratic countries, the way forward would therefore be propounded on the principle of inclusivity. It is thus fair to say that it is time that France should terminate the age-old laïcité principle involving secularism and try to switch towards the nuances of modernity. While it may seem like an impressionable mind would get influenced by a certain religion due to the religious freedom of another’s expression, such apprehension is not true in its entirety. The display of symbols and attires of different religious faiths inculcate the element of togetherness amongst people. It also helps us to accept people for whom they are meaningful, making us tolerant towards the citizens living in a society. </p>
